## How to Study?

### Calculus and Linear Algebra

### Chemistry

Definitley take notes, stuff gets real confusing real fast, and the only way to keep up with it is to make notes of what's being taught.
All units will have topics from what you've studied in your senior school years, so there is nothing much to worry about. There will be few advanced topics at the end of each unit. - [Kunal Keshan](https://github.com/kunalkeshan)
