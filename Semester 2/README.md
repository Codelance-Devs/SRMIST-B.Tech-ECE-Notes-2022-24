## How to Learn?

### Advanced Calculus and Complex Analysis

- Solve with Teacher in the Class from the starting.
- Try and do question by yourself also in between, that way you'll have an idea of what to do before the exams even start.
- Use the Tutorial sheets that your professors share, that's more than enough to prepare for exams.
