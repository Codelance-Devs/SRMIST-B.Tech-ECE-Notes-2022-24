> âš  Semester 1 - 3 notes are based on **online classes**. Study material might be relevant but not the test notes. Take it with a grain of salt.

## Motivation

When I first joined college, I started off with Online classes and I had no contact with seniors whatsoever. I found it tough to find study material and prepare for my exams without any support. Even after classes began offline, we would be able to get the material  but not the insight on how to use them. 

You'll hardly have any contact with your seniors until you're part of some club, working together on some project or a research paper. I've made this repo to support any person who requires the relavent study material present here.

> This repo is my step towards being the senior I needed the most as a Junior.
