## How to Learn?

### Analog and Digital Communication

- The topics are mostly theoretical with a few numericals distributed across each unit.
- Lot's of block diagram for each type of modulater, so you'll need to have practiced them by hand before attending the exam.
- Lab consists mostly of kit, so it will be pretty easy to do them. 

#### Resources

### Microprocessor, Microcontroller and Interfacing Techniques

- Lot's or architecture, block diagrams and modes to remember for each unit. You'll need to be consistent with the diagrams by practicing them well before the exams.
- Both lab and theory have ALP (Assembly Language Program) will be a bit tough in the beginning but you'll get a hang of it with practice.
- Be attentive in lab, it's a bit tough to do them if you've never done one by yourself.

#### Resources

### Digital Signal Processing

- Is mostly numerical based with a lot of methods. There are a few derivation components present too.
- Lab is all computer based. You'll be working on Scilab.
- If you're familiar with the syntax, then you can work with Scilab easily.

#### Resources

### Discrete Mathematics for Engineers

- Most of the math here is basic, but there are lots of theoretical stuff to remember. So you'll need to have practice for this.
- Try to solve the tutorial sheets that your professor will share with you.
- Take notes during class.

#### Resources

---

### Python and Scientific Python

- Syntax for python and a few libraries like numpy, matplotlib, random will be the main focus.
- Not necessary to take notes, but try to code in python by yourself. You'll need the practical experience to get an idea of how to answer the questions.
- Most of the lab codes are also pretty straight forward, only a few will be complicated so prepare for those before hand.

### Sustainable Development

- Is mostly theoretical, but also has a few numericals in each chapter.
- Theory stuff is envinorment related, so it's easy to work on. Have a practice of the numericals before hand.

### MOOCs / Industrial Training / Seminar - I

* If you're more into ECE then Industrial Training or Seminar is something you can take on. 
* In Industrial training you'll have to visit some company, get an idea of how they work inside and create a report on it.
* Seminar is quite similar to your mini project for the labs, you can do it on any topic. Here too you'll have to create a report and a presentation to show it your faculty incharge.
* Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) - as the name suggest any online course (for ECE students, preferably ECE related, but depends on your faculty incharge) from NPTEL, Coursera, or Udemy. 

#### Resources

If you're applying for MOOCs and wish to take it from Coursera, you'll have to apply for financial aid. Here's a template that you can use to apply for one.

Why are you applying for financial aid?

I am an undergrad student at [College Name] currently in my [Year] majoring in [Branch]. I am a student with no income and therefore it is not possible for me to pay the fee. Also my major is computer engineering, therefore, this course will help me a lot in developing a skill that will help me in improving my skills. I want to start my career in [Field Name] and this can be a great start for my career. That is why I want this financial aid. I will commit to all my deadlines and will try my best to complete the course. As a tech enthusiast, I want to learn [Field Name] and I will commit to all the deadlines for the course. This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.

How taking this course will help you achieve your career goals?

I am an undergrad student at [College Name] currently in my [Year] majoring in [Branch]  My major is computer engineering, therefore, this course will help me a lot in developing a skill that will help me in improving my skills. I want to start my career in [Course] and this can be a great start for my career. That is why I want this financial aid. I will commit to all my deadlines and will try my best to complete the course. As a tech enthusiast, I want to learn deep learning and I will commit to all the deadlines for the course. This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
